AI-assisted optimization for categories, rules, spending, and subscriptions.

## Usage

```
/agent-smith-optimize <target> [options]
```

## Optimization Targets

- `categories` - Category structure and hierarchy
- `rules` - Categorization rules (accuracy, coverage)
- `spending` - Spending patterns and reduction opportunities
- `subscriptions` - Recurring charges and subscription management

## Options

- `--aggressive` - More aggressive optimization recommendations
- `--preview` - Show recommendations without applying
- `--focus=AREA` - Focus on specific area (e.g., "dining", "utilities")

## Examples

```bash
# Optimize category structure
/agent-smith-optimize categories

# Improve rule accuracy and coverage
/agent-smith-optimize rules

# Find spending reduction opportunities
/agent-smith-optimize spending

# Analyze subscriptions and recurring charges
/agent-smith-optimize subscriptions

# Preview aggressive optimizations for dining
/agent-smith-optimize spending --aggressive --focus=dining --preview
```

## What Gets Optimized

**Categories:**
- Consolidate similar categories
- Fix hierarchy issues
- Identify unused categories
- Suggest better groupings
- Align with ATO categories for tax

**Rules:**
- Improve accuracy (reduce overrides)
- Increase coverage (more auto-categorization)
- Remove conflicting rules
- Optimize priority ordering
- Suggest new rules for patterns

**Spending:**
- Identify trending-up categories
- Find unusual spikes
- Compare to benchmarks
- Suggest reduction targets
- Track progress vs. goals

**Subscriptions:**
- Detect recurring payments
- Calculate annual costs
- Find unused/redundant services
- Compare alternatives
- Track price increases

## Optimization Process

1. **Analysis:** Examine current state
2. **Opportunities:** Identify improvements
3. **Recommendations:** Suggest specific changes
4. **Impact:** Estimate savings/improvement
5. **Approval:** Get your confirmation
6. **Apply:** Execute changes (unless --preview)

## What You'll Get

**Recommendations:**
- Specific actions to take
- Expected impact ($ or % improvement)
- Risk assessment
- Implementation steps

**Before/After:**
- Current state metrics
- Projected improvements
- Success criteria

**Monitoring:**
- Track optimization results
- Measure actual vs. expected
- Continuous improvement suggestions
